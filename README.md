<<<<<<< FLUTTER SIMPLE SHOPPING APP
A simple mobile shopping app built with flutter dart framework

It consists of two pages in the bottom navigation bar [Products][Checkout],

The [Product] page contains the items to be sold with a [plus] button on each template to send product to cart
The [Checkout Page] integrates the cart to recieve the products added by the user from the [Product] page and navigates the user to the [Order Successful] page

Any contributions on how to improve the app should be relayed to me.
